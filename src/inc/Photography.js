            Before booking a photographer, allow me to take you for an
            engagement session for free to establish if we bond (to get a feel
            for one another) and show you the quality of pictures for your day.
            After 10 years of working with an array of professional
            photographers, I was able to establish From the Heart Photography 15
            years ago, blending all the best attributes of my colleagues and
            removing the boredom and rules of time that a lot in the industry
            have.

            Its now been 15 years of wedding photography with professionalism of
            uniform, equipment and results adding a sense of relaxation to the
            bride, groom and wedding party giving full day coordination along
            with it. An iPhone can now take an awesome picture so careful of why
            youâ€™re investing in a camera that someone carries rather than the
            person behind it. We also include standard video with all
            photography packages.
