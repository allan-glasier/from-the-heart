              I wish we could put into words how grateful we are to the both of
              you. Not only did Celebrity Music coordinate our rehearsal dinner;
              they also insured our wedding day was flawless. It did not matter
              what was asked Joe & Sharon were on top of everything!! Our guests
              raved about our amazing coordinator/DJ/MC duo from the moment they
              first heard Joe over the mic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sharon and Joe were constantly insuring everything was okay and
              did anything and everything asked to make sure we had the most
              amazing day. This included bringing drinks to us where ever we
              happened to be, helping with 'bridely' duties and just being
              overall amazing.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              We have no doubt in our minds that our day would not have been the
              same without the two of you there. Our guests had a blast and the
              dance floor was full the entire night. Thank you does not seem to
              suffice for all that you guys have done to make sure our wedding
              day was out of a fairy tale.

              Joe and Sharon were absolutely amazing to work with! They had
              wonderful tips at our planning meetings, ran our rehearsal, and
              kept everything on the day of the wedding running smoothly. They
              were incredibly organized and professional, and were prepared for
              any little thing that could have happened. During the reception
              they kept our dance floor so full, we had a blast! They picked
              songs that kept everyone - little kids to grandparents- dancing
              and singing along! I would 100% recommend Joe and Sharon,
              incredible to work with! Thank you for making my wedding memorable
              and amazing!

              Joe and Sharon are absolutely amazing. They went absolutely above
              and beyond what a regular dj/photographer would do. I would
              recommend them to anybody getting married. They're both absolutely
              amazing and I don't know what we would have done without them.
              Absolutely amazing photographers and DJs, had the crowd going the
              whole event and took beautiful photos

              We were SO happy with our wedding last year, this couple did a
              fantastic job with our bi-cultural wedding- making sure both sides
              of our families music was incorporated keeping EVERYONE dancing
              all night. We would highly recommend that you enlist their
              services FIRST - before anyone else. They have been working in the
              industry in Windsor long enough to give you the best guidance on
              all of your other vendors. They spend time with you, they get to
              know you and they care about how your day will go. They are
              honest, professional, and worth every penny.

              We chose to hire Joe and Sharon for our wedding and they were
              incredible! They work so well together as a team and make sure
              that everything is taken care of so that you can focus on the
              memorable moments. Joe and Sharon went above and beyond to make
              sure that we were completely catered to all night long! They are
              very accommodating and will work with you to make sure that
              everything goes off without a hitch. Sharon made sure that every
              small detail was attended to and taken care of and Joe had the
              dance floor packed all night long! To anyone that is getting
              married I would highly recommend that you meet with Joe and Sharon
              before hiring anyone else.

              My wife and I just got married this past Sunday. From the moment
              we met Joe and Sharon we knew that we had a winning combination on
              our hands. They were the most pleasant and funny people we could
              have wished to have on our team while we were planning our
              wedding. They were soooo much more than a DJ and videographer.
              They were there every step of the way ensuring that our special
              day was as perfect as could be. Joe has an amazing sense of
              humour( a perfect m c) while Sharon has an impeccable attention to
              detail and was there making sure that we were ok throughout our
              day. The attention and professionalism that Joe and Sharon
              provided us was absolutely amazing. The music was awesome and our
              guests danced and danced all night long. We were so glad that we
              chose Celebrity Music to join us on our special day!! We would
              DEFINITELY recommend Joe and Sharon for your special functions.
              You won't be disappointed!!!

              I've had the opportunity to work with Joe for a few weddings now.
              I must say everyone needs to hire Celebrity Music. Joe is honest
              and gets things done! His sense of humour is always entertaining
              the morning of the wedding! Being a makeup artist in the industry
              I look forward to working with Celebrity Music. They definitely
              wear many hats in the process leading to your wedding day. They
              are organized, efficient and will most certainly take care of you!
              I cannot say enough great things about them. I highly recommend
              them!

              Joe and Sharon have changed what it means to offer wedding DJ
              services. You might as well fire your wedding coordinator and hire
              these two to run the whole show.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Joe is an excellent DJ, able to command the room with his booming
              radio voice and knows what it takes to get people dancing all
              night.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sharon is the hidden gem in this operation, she watches every
              detail throughout the night and has a solution to literally any
              situation that may come up. She provided some key necessities that
              my bride and I didn't even think we could need, she reported to us
              on anything time-sensitive that was happening throughout the night
              and silently handled various little challenges that a wedding
              inevitably has. She even made sure everyone got onto the busses at
              the end of the night!{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="mb-0">
              The duo are absolute professionals and I would recommend them to
              anyone getting married. Wedding DJ industry beware - the
              competition is fierce in these two, and the road is long if you
              want to provide the value that these two bring. Plus they're super
              nice and always focused on making your wedding what YOU want it to
              be. Thank you Sharon and Joe, A+++ service.
