          <p>
            I wish we could put into words how grateful we are to the both of
            you. Not only did Celebrity Music coordinate our rehearsal dinner;
            they also insured our wedding day was flawless. It did not matter
            what was asked Joe & Sharon were on top of everything!! Our guests
            raved about our amazing coordinator/DJ/MC duo from the moment they
            first heard Joe over the mic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharon and Joe were constantly insuring everything was okay and did
            anything and everything asked to make sure we had the most amazing
            day. This included bringing drinks to us where ever we happened to
            be, helping with 'bridely' duties and just being overall amazing.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-0">
            We have no doubt in our minds that our day would not have been the
            same without the two of you there. Our guests had a blast and the
            dance floor was full the entire night. Thank you does not seem to
            suffice for all that you guys have done to make sure our wedding day
            was out of a fairy tale.
