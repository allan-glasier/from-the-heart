          I started Celebrity Music 30 years ago because there was a void in the
          city of a DJ that cared. Most DJs sit at a booth with the lights off,
          not caring about the crowd. I had to change that. Approximately 2,700
          weddings later, we are the company that are booked through word of
          mouth rather than ads or wedding shows. Trust opinions, not a
          brochure. A wedding is a live performance, and we believe in making
          your day memorable and run smoothly. Over the years, we have taken
          pride in being able to read a crowd and keep everyone happy. Your meal
          may be good, but if your entertainment isnâ€™t, then everyone goes home
          early and will not remember your wedding. Numerable times, even years
          later, we receive glowing reviews by guests of a wedding Celebrity
          Music has been a part of. It is often remarked upon how much fun the
          reception was. As first impressions go, Celebrity Music aims high.
